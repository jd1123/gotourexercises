Tour of Go Exercise Solutions
====================

These are my solutions for the exercises at http://tour.golang.org

I am just learning Go, so these are by no means entirely correct or unique. But this is how I solved them.

Each exercise is named <number>.go and corresponds to the module of that number. Some of the exercises aren't exercises at all. But since you cannot implement the "net/http" etc with the online environment.
